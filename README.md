# Psych 204b
Final project for Psych 204b, Spring 2016

Thanks for visiting! This folder includes key files for my final project. The code is a living documentâ€”feel free to take it apart, point out errors, or use it on your own data!

There are two Jupyter notebooks in this folder: one which shows my preprocessing and fixed-effects modeling process, and the the other which runs representational similarity analysis on the pre-processed data.

The two folders, 'mask' and 'model', include assets used especially for this project. 'mask' includes anatomically defined ROIs used to constrain the RSA; and 'model' includes a modified version of the original .par files.
